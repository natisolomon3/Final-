# Final Project - July 25th, 2024
We are analyzing Lebron James's regular season statistics compared to their Playoff statistics. We want to see how much improvment they may or may not have in certain categories with metrics of their Field Goal %, 3 Point %, Free Throw %, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Points. Based on data that we gathered from Basketball references we could see these individuals' averages based on each year and their comparison of how they perform in the regular season and playoffs.
