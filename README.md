INFO 2201 Final Project 

## Project Overview:

We are analyzing Lebron James's regular season statistics compared to his Playoff statistics. We want to see how much improvment he may or may not have in certain categories with metrics of his 3 Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Points. Based on data gathered from Basketball references we could see LeBron's averages based on each year and the comparison of how he performs in the regular season and playoffs. 

## Data Source:

We obtained the data from Basketball Reference, specifically from LeBron James's player page on the website. The hyperlink to the data source is LeBron James on Basketball Reference. (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

The data is in a CSV format, available as both regular season and playoff statistics. It includes various performance metrics such as points, rebounds, assists, and more.

Pros:
Easily accessible and publicly available.
Consistently updated with new performance data every season.
Comprehensive historical data spanning LeBron James's entire career.

Cons:
Requires cleaning to convert into a usable CSV format due to formatting inconsistencies.
May include redundant or unnecessary metrics that need to be filtered out.

## Data Pulling:
We sourced the data from Basketball Reference, using the specific URL for LeBron James's performance statistics. (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

We downloaded the data directly from the website and converted it into a CSV file. This involved navigating to the page, selecting the relevant tables for both regular season and playoff statistics, and using the download options provided on the site to export the data.

## Data Cleaning:

We made several key decisions during the data-cleaning process:

Removed unnecessary metrics such as turnovers, games started, and personal fouls, as they were not directly relevant to assessing LeBron James's offensive abilities.
Addressed formatting issues and ensured that the data was consistently structured across both regular season and playoff statistics.

Selected: Key performance metrics such as points, blocks, steals, and rebounds.
Deleted: Metrics like turnovers, games started, and personal fouls, which did not significantly impact the analysis of his offensive performance.
The selected metrics were chosen for their relevance in evaluating LeBron's performance, particularly in the context of offensive play. Metrics like turnovers and personal fouls were deemed less relevant and were excluded to the dataset and focused on the most impactful statistics.

## Refelction on Visuzlation:

The cleaned data allows for clear and insightful visualizations that highlight the differences between LeBron James's regular season and playoff performances. 

Comparative bar charts showing average points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks and other key metrics in regular season vs. playoffs.
Line graphs to track performance trends over the years.
Bar graphs to show the averages between Rsgular Season and Playoffs 


## Storytelling:

This analysis is particularly helpful for sports analysts, commentators, and fans interested in understanding LeBron James's performance trends. It also has implications for sports betting, where understanding player performance in crucial games like playoffs can inform betting strategies.

Other people should be able to conclude the significance of LeBron's enhanced performance during playoff games compared to the regular season. This insight can inform discussions on his legacy, impact on game outcomes, and strategic decisions in sports betting. The cleaned and visualized data provides a clear narrative on how a star athlete's performance can vary in high-stakes situations, emphasizing the importance of considering different contexts in sports analysis.
