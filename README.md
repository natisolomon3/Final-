INFO 2201 Final Project 

## Project Overview:

We are analyzing Lebron James's regular season statistics compared to his Playoff statistics. We want to see how much improvment he may or may not have in certain categories with metrics of his 3 Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Points. Based on data gathered from Basketball references we could see LeBron's averages based on each year and the comparison of how he performs in the regular season and playoffs. 

## Data Source:

We obtained the data from Basketball Reference, specifically from LeBron James's player page on the website. The hyperlink to the data source is LeBron James on Basketball Reference. (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

The data is in a CSV format, available as both regular season and playoff statistics. It includes various performance metrics such as points, rebounds, assists, and more.

While Basketball Reference is a highly reputable and widely used source for basketball statistics, it is important to recognize that relying on a single data source may introduce biases or limitations. However, the credibility of Basketball Reference is reinforced by its recognition and citation by authoritative sports entities such as ESPN. Unlike other sources on the internet, which may be influenced by subjective opinions of LeBron superfans or detractors, Basketball Reference provides objective and verifiable data. To enhance the robustness of our analysis, cross-referencing with additional credible sources or databases could further validate our findings and provide a more comprehensive perspective on LeBron James's performance. 

Pros:
Easily accessible and publicly available.
Consistently updated with new performance data every season.
Comprehensive historical data spanning LeBron James's entire career.

Cons:
Requires cleaning to convert into a usable CSV format due to formatting inconsistencies.
May include redundant or unnecessary metrics that need to be filtered out.

## Data Pulling:
We sourced the data from Basketball Reference, using the specific URL for LeBron James's performance statistics. (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

We downloaded the data directly from the website and converted it into a CSV file. This involved navigating to the page, selecting the relevant tables for both regular season and playoff statistics, and using the download options provided on the site to export the data.

## Data Cleaning:

We made several key decisions during the data-cleaning process:

Removed unnecessary metrics such as turnovers, games started, and personal fouls, as they were not directly relevant to assessing LeBron James's offensive abilities.
Addressed formatting issues and ensured that the data was consistently structured across both regular season and playoff statistics.

Selected: Key performance metrics such as points, blocks, steals, and rebounds.
Deleted: Metrics like turnovers, games started, and personal fouls, which did not significantly impact the analysis of his offensive performance.
The selected metrics were chosen for their relevance in evaluating LeBron's performance, particularly in the context of offensive play. Metrics like turnovers and personal fouls were deemed less relevant and were excluded to the dataset and focused on the most impactful statistics.

## Refelction on Visuzlation:

Our cleaned data enables us to create clear and insightful visualizations that effectively highlight the differences between LeBron James's regular season and playoff performances.

To compare these performances, we've used several types of visualizations:

Bar Charts: These charts show the average points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, along with other key metrics, side by side for the regular season and playoffs. This makes it easy to see how his performance varies between the two seasons. We also considered using bar charts to compare the number of games played in the regular season versus the playoffs, which helps provide context for the differences in performance metrics.

Line Graphs: These graphs track performance trends over the years. They allow us to observe how LeBron's performance in different metrics changes over time, giving us a dynamic view of his career progression. We noticed some interesting trends and periods where his performance significantly changed, which adds depth to our analysis.

Stacked Bar Charts: By using stacked bar charts, we can compare multiple metrics simultaneously within the same visualization. For example, showing points, rebounds, and assists together for each season provides a comprehensive overview of LeBron's all-around contributions.

Heat Maps: Heat maps visualize the intensity of LeBron's performance metrics across different seasons. This type of visualization helps us identify peak performance periods and how his contributions vary throughout his career.

Box Plots: Box plots show the distribution and variability of LeBron's performance metrics in the regular season and playoffs. This helps us understand the consistency and range of his performances, highlighting outliers and trends.

Implications and Considerations:

When interpreting these visualizations, it's important to consider the differences in the number of games played in the regular season versus the playoffs. The regular season typically consists of 82 games, while the playoffs can vary in length depending on how far a team advances. This disparity can impact the averages and overall performance metrics, so it's crucial to account for the context of game volume when drawing conclusions.

These visualizations are crucial for drawing meaningful insights from the data, making it easier to understand and communicate LeBron James's performance trends throughout his career. They provide a comprehensive view of how his performance adapts to high-stakes situations, offering valuable information for sports analysts, commentators, and fans. Furthermore, these insights can inform discussions on his legacy, strategic decisions in sports betting, and understanding the dynamics of performance in regular versus high-pressure scenarios.



## Storytelling:

This analysis is particularly helpful for sports analysts, commentators, and fans interested in understanding LeBron James's performance trends. It also has implications for sports betting, where understanding player performance in crucial games like playoffs can inform betting strategies.

Other people should be able to conclude the significance of LeBron's enhanced performance during playoff games compared to the regular season. This insight can inform discussions on his legacy, impact on game outcomes, and strategic decisions in sports betting. The cleaned and visualized data provides a clear narrative on how a star athlete's performance can vary in high-stakes situations, emphasizing the importance of considering different contexts in sports analysis.
