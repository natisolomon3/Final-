INFO 2201 Final Project 

Project:
We are analyzing Lebron James's regular season statistics compared to their Playoff statistics. We want to see how much improvment he may or may not have in certain categories with metrics of their Field Goal %, 3 Point %, Free Throw %, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Points. Based on data gathered from Basketball references we could see LeBron's averages based on each year and the comparison of how he performs in the regular season and playoffs.
